# ARIA Disclosure Widgets  
Progressively enhanced disclosure widgets (show/hide toggle areas) built with vanilla JavaScript and ARIA attributes.

A disclosure widget consists of a button that toggles the state of its associated content to be expanded or collapsed. In native HTML, a disclosure widget would best parallel to a `detail` and `summary` markup pattern.
